Water's like me. It's laaazy¬†... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things A little happy sunlight shining through there. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Payment API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

This is the way you take out your flustrations. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

You can do anything your heart can imagine. In life you need colors. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. You can spend all day playing with mountains. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. It's cold, but it's beautiful.

# Recipe Book

## Topics

- database modeling.
- migration scripts.
- seeding.
- knex.

## Assignment

Design the **data model** for a _recipe book_ application, then use `Knex migrations and seeding` functionality to build a `SQLite3` database based on the model and seed it with test data.

The requirements for the system, as stated by the client are:

- have a way to manage recipes.
- have a way to manage ingredients.
- a **recipe** could have more than one **ingredient** and the same **ingredient** can be used in multiple recipes. Examples are _"cup of corn flour"_ or _"gram of butter"_.
- when saving the ingredients for a **recipe** capture the quantity required for that **ingredient** as a floating number.
- have a way to save step by step instructions for preparing a recipe.

**Hint**: Before writing any code, write out all desired tables in the data model and determine all relationships between tables. 

### Migrations and Seeds

- Write a migration file that creates all tables necessary to model this data
- Write seed files to populate the tables with test data. **Hint**: Keep your recipes *very* simple or this step could become extremely time consuming.

### Data Access

In addition to the `migrations` and `seeding` scripts, write a data access file that **exports** an object with the following functions:

- `getRecipes()`: should return a list of all recipes in the database.
- `getShoppingList(recipe_id)`: should return a list of all ingredients and quantities for a given recipe
- `getInstructions(recipe_id)`: should return a list of step by step instructions for preparing a recipe

Organize and name your files anyway you see fit.

## Stretch Problem

Build the following endpoints. Write any additional data access helpers as needed.

- `GET /api/recipes/`: all recipes (without details about ingredients or steps)
- `GET /api/recipes/:id/shoppingList`: a list of ingredients and quantites for a single recipe
- `GET /api/recipes/:id/instructions`: a correctly ordered list of how to prepare a single recipe
- `GET /api/ingredients/:id/recipes`: all recipes in the system that utilize a single ingredient
